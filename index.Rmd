The project is stored as a website link under 

Â´username.github.io/name_of_the projectÂ´

In my case it would be under: 

mlebertheyl.github.io/rmd_page

This gives an error because the domain is not properly set yet.

To set the domain:

-> Go to github settings on the repository you are working on

-> Pages

Tell github this repository will be staged as a webpage:

-> None -> main

-> Folder to be used for the rendered file will be /docs instead of the / folder /(root)

-> get message with url

-> once the message is green your page is ready
